    "The enemy of a good plan is the dream of a perfect plan.",
    "Tactics is the art of using troops in battle;\n strategy is the art of using battles to win the war",
    "Kind-hearted people might of course think there was some ingenious way to disarm or defeat an enemy without too much bloodshed, and might imagine this is the true goal of the art of war. Pleasant as it sounds; it is a fallacy that must be exposed: War is such a dangerous business that the mistakes which come from kindness are the very worst.",
